This blog will cover some of the work I've been doing recently. Specifically around automation and DevOps culture. It'll most likely touch on subjects like Infrastructure as Code, managing DevOps teams, and tips to deploy stuff every day.

The aim is to publish an new post each week, but I'll inevitably miss a few when things catch fire. 

Thanks for reading, and good for you for reading all the way back to the beginning.
